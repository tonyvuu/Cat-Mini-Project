    <b> Hello my name is Tony Vu and I own two black cats. Dogs used to be my favorite pet but growing up and fostering a kitty during the pandemic made me realize their companionship and compatibility matches to mine.
       They are often more independent and require less constant attention than dogs since they are generally content spending time alone and don't need as much outdoor exercise as dogs do. I prefer a quieter and lower-maintenance pet, which makes cat a good fit. Less than 2 months after fostering my first kitten, I decided to do some research and look for another breed of cat that can fit with my family. Each breed is unique and need some special treatment. 
       That's important to know when deciding to adopt the perfect cat! &#x1F604;</b>
