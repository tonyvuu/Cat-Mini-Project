    <b>Greetings, my name is Ursula Still and I am like no other you may have encountered. In this, my very first group project as a pertains to my software development program via DigiCrafts is the delivery of what we’ve learn together and collectively as a team.  Our project is about cats.
      I’ll be the first to say that I am in no way a cat person, however, this project was not about me. It was about the team coming up with a project that everyone would be proud of.  Inasmuch as I am more of a dog person, what I have found within my natural talents and giftings is
      I’m resourceful,
      can naturally think outside the box and into the heart of the user,
      can work with the team when necessary, even in my learning and
      can still fulfill the innate design skills by fully encompassing who I am.
      I am all about the total UX/IX experience. It’s not just about the back and front-end development of a project for the client, it is almost always about the end-user and their experience - what they see, how they’re touched, what they feel and experience from said side. Even as much as I adore dogs more, my strength to project and my team besides development was ultimately the end-user.
      That they can experience everything fun, bold, and playful about cats and their future for fur baby. Our initial palette was very above yet my thought was what about those that are color blind amongst other things. That was invoked in a cat inspired color palette centered around our “meowscot” (U. Still). Besides the above, some other cat inspired thoughts were things like
      the woman yelling at the cat pointer/cursor (popular recent memory)
      a “meow” on click for the cat facts,
      a hoverable mouse “Please adopt me” over our meowscot , and
      Specific terminology, and
      4 viable resources here locally in ATLANTA to directly connect the end-user with their potential new fam via our navbar.
      The desire for cat lovers to feel prematurely connected to their desire and for non-cat lovers, like me, to feel connected in spite of. Even I am attracted to the site which says much.
      Thank you for taking time to explore.
      Ursula Still, female/she, hold a Computer Info Systems degree, student in DigiCrafts Software Dev program, a young 53yo, 27yr wife,
      mom of 4 - 24, 21, 16, &16, preparing to reenter the workforce and impact the world. ! &#x1F604;</b>

    <b> Hello my name is Tony Vu and I own two black cats. Dogs used to be my favorite pet but growing up and fostering a kitty during the pandemic made me realize their companionship and compatibility matches to mine.
       They are often more independent and require less constant attention than dogs since they are generally content spending time alone and don't need as much outdoor exercise as dogs do. I prefer a quieter and lower-maintenance pet, which makes cat a good fit. Less than 2 months after fostering my first kitten, I decided to do some research and look for another breed of cat that can fit with my family. Each breed is unique and need some special treatment. 
       That's important to know when deciding to adopt the perfect cat! &#x1F604;</b>
